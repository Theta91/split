split is a command-line utility that splits ape, wav or flac files based on a
cuesheet, transcodes them to flac (at compression level 8), adds tags based on
the metadata in the cuesheet and renames them based on the tags (in the form
%tracknumber% %tracktitle%).

To use split, you must have, at minimum, cuetools and flac installed. In
addition, you must have the script cuetag installed as /usr/bin/cuetag.sh. Some
distributions install it as /usr/bin/cuetag; if your distribution does this, you
must run ln -s /usr/bin/cuetag /usr/bin/cuetag.sh or adjust the script
appropriately. If you want to split ape images, you must have mac installed.

Usage of split follows the form
$ split -ext "top-level directory"
where ext is one of ape, wav or flac and corresponds to the extension of the
image you wish to split. The top-level directory can be either a folder
containing numerous folders of images you wish to split or a single folder. If
it is the former, and contains mixed folders with ape and flac images, you
should run split with the -flac option first or you'll wind up with a lot of
empty 'converted' folders and a lot of complaints on the command-line (although
nothing bad will happen).
