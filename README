split.sh is a command-line utility that splits ape, wav or flac files based on a
cuesheet, transcodes them to flac (at compression level 8), adds tags based on
the metadata in the cuesheet and renames them based on the tags (in the form
%tracknumber% %tracktitle%).

To use split.sh, you must have, at minimum, shntool, flac and cuetools installed.
In addition, you must have the script cuetag installed as /usr/bin/cuetag.sh.
Some distributions install it as /usr/bin/cuetag; if your distribution does this,
you must run ln -s /usr/bin/cuetag /usr/bin/cuetag.sh or adjust the script
appropriately. If you want to split ape images, you must have mac installed.

Usage of split follows the form
$ split.sh -ext "top-level directory"
where ext is one of ape, wav or flac and corresponds to the extension of the
image you wish to split. The top-level directory can be either a folder
containing numerous folders of images you wish to split or a single folder. If
it is the former, and contains mixed folders with ape and flac images, you
should run split with the -flac option first or you'll wind up with a lot of
empty 'converted' folders and a lot of complaints on the command-line (although
nothing bad will happen).

The accuracy of the metadata in the cuesheet is critical to split.sh's operation.
For this reason, you should make sure all fields correspond to your (or others)
standards before using split.sh. For classical music, you should make sure each
track contains a line indicating the composer (COMPOSER "[composer]") and a line
indicating the performer of the work (PERFORMER "[performer(s)]"). The default
is to just have PERFORMER which will result in your files having both the Artist
and Performer(/Original Artist, depending on where you're viewing the metadata)
as PERFORMER; introducing the COMPOSER field results in COMPOSER being set as
Artist and PERFORMER as Performer.
